## Bus/Rapid Transit Stops 

To begin analyzing my data, I wanted to look at some basic comparisons between demographic data and the number of bus/rapid transit stops in different cities served by the MBTA.

To start, a plot of municipality population and the number of stops in said municipality:

It's hard to get a sense for what relationship (if any) there for municipalities other than Boston (which has a population over 600K and nearly 2000 stops).

\newpage

I recreated the above plot, removing Boston:

Some other demographics compared with number of stops include per-capita income:

\newpage

And property value:

An initial look at these plots suggests that population is the greatest driving force behind number of stops for municipalities outside of Boston (this is something I intend to look at more).

I also wanted to begin looking at the data for Boston proper. The city of Boston has 26 neighborhoods, and demographic information is available for 22 of them. Using a geojson file and census data, both made available by the city of Boston, I made the following maps to get a sense for the neighborhoods.

First, mapping the population by neighborhood:

\newpage

Then, mapping the number of stops by neighborhood:

\newpage

And lastly, mapping the per-capita income by neighborhood:

![](figures/boston_map_income.png)

\newpage

After making these maps, I created similar figures to those for non-boston stops, both plotting population and number of stops, and income and number of stops.
